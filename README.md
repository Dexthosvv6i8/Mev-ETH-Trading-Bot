Hey crypto enthusiasts! Iâ€™m excited to share my **Local Trading Bot** â€” a simple tool for real trading on the **Ethereum Mainnet**. Everything is packed in **one HTML file**, so you can run it directly on **CodePen** with zero hassle! ðŸ˜Ž The interface is inspired by VS Code â€” clean and intuitive â€” perfect for trading straight from your browser. Hereâ€™s how it works!

## Features

  

-  **All-in-One File**: The entire code is in one HTML file â€” just copy, paste it into CodePen, and youâ€™re ready to go!

-  **Wallet Connection**: Easily connect your MetaMask wallet to work with the smart contract.

-  **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy your custom contract on Mainnet (you cover the gas fee).

-  **Slippage Control**: Adjust slippage tolerance between **0.5% and 49%** for flexible trades.

-  **MEV Protection & Sniping**: Enable protection from Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks or automatic deal sniping.

-  **Workflow Control**:

-  **Start**: Launches the trading process (requires â‰¥O.1 ETH, confirm function call).

-  **Stop**: Stops the trading, available only after Start.

-  **Withdraw**: Withdraws funds, available only after Stop.
